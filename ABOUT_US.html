                    <p>
                        Cafe Maior started out with a rolling van, finding spots that would attract joggers and bikers — the kind of place where they could stop by, take a break, and enjoy a cup of coffee or a refreshing drink to brighten their day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After some time on the road, we decided to expand and rent a spot at a food park. Our journey took us to different locations: first in Lucban, right in front of Kamay ni Hesus at a parking area, then later in Mayuuwi near Iñigo’s Sports Center. We also set up shop at Food Park Treehouse in Pleasantville, Iyam. Some days were great, while others were quiet, especially in places that were a bit far from the usual crowd.

                        Now, we’ve found our latest and still ongoing home at Banchetto De Lucena, located behind MMG Plaza — and the story continues from here.
